Native

    Native keyword is only applicable for methods and not anywhere else.

    Native keyword is used to indicate that a particular method is implemented in C or C++ and not in java.
    -> why implement method in another programming language?
        . java is not good with machine level communication.
        . if require to interact with machine level, might need to use another language in some software.
        . a part of software can be already implemented in native programming language and have to make use of it.

    Native can never be used with abstract keyword because for abstract there has to be no implementation.

    Native methods cannot be declared as strictfp.

    Major disadvantage of native keyword is that there is no guarantee that the code will be platform independent.


Transient

    Serialization is a process of converting an object into a file or stream before transmitting it across the network. Converting the object back from its serialized form to actual object is know as deserialization.

    Transient is used when you might not want to safe a particular value within an object to file due to security contraints.
    If you are serializing an object to a file, you might want java to skip serializing this particular instance or class variable into serialized form.
    You can declared the variable with transient keyword.
